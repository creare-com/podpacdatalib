# PODPAC DATALIB

> Pipeline for Observation Data Processing Analysis and Collaboration

Data wrangling and processing of geospatial data should be seamless
so that earth scientists can focus on science.

The purpose of PODPAC is to facilitate:

 * Access of data products
 * Subsetting of data products
 * Projecting and interpolating data products
 * Combining/compositing data products
 * Analysis of data products
 * Sharing of algorithms and data products
 * Use of cloud computing architectures (AWS) for processing

The purpose of this companion repository is to provide access to specific, publically available datasets using PODPAC.

## Installation
